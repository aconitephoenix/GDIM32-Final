My contributions were mainly focused on the UI/Dialogue elements; I wrote most of the UI NPC/Interactable/Controller classes, heavily racking my brain when it came to figuring out the dialogue methods (especially the IEnmuerator TypeLine which I still have to fully fix...).  
Personally, I believe that our proposal was detailed enough to build my parts of the project, and actually assisted in thinking about how to architect our solutions. For example, the plan that we made in week 7 helped me navigate the inheritance required for Interactables (as in how the NPC class should inherit from the Interactable class, since I was kind of having trouble with differentiating interactable detection until I remembered inheritance was a thing). I referred to the Trello board that we made every now and then to keep track of my tasks and mark which one I'd completed just to ensure I'd focus on the most important parts of the project first (aka the DIALOGUE!!!)
